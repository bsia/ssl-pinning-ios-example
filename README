This is a simple iOS application intended to demonstrate SSL pinning.

The application consists of a simple master/detail application that
displays the first page of results when searching Twitter for #SSL tweets.

The Twitter search API is accessed over HTTPS. This application
demonstrates how to use the built-in iOS APIs to ensure that the SSL
certificate presented by a server is signed by a specific certificate
authority (CA). This is, naturally, in addition to the normal certificate
validation that takes place when initiating HTTPS connections.
